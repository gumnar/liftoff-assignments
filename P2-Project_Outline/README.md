## Submission Instructions

### Overview
More and more people are cutting the cord; dropping their cable packages, my own household included. 
With that comes the loss of an effective app for tracking which TV shows you are watching, which episodes you've watched, and which shows you're still planning to watch. 
Even more importantly you have no easy way of getting notified when one of  your favorite shows comes out with a new episode.

This application will serve the purpose of collecting and tracking the programing that you love and reminding you when new, unwatched episodes are released. 
It will allow each user to create their own curated list of television shows complete with box art, description, and user ratings. 
The user will have the ability to be notified when new episodes come out via text or email and will have the ability to set the frequency of such updates. 

### Features
1. User Login -- Users will be able to create accounts and log into the app. Each user will have their own profile page 
2.	Watch List -- Users will be able to add shows to their watch lists
3.	Search -- Users will be able to search for a given show in their watch list
4.	Mark Watched -- Users will be able to mark a given show or episode as watched
5.	Reminders -- Users will be able to request notifications based on a frequency they define (weekly, new episodes, new seasons, etc)
